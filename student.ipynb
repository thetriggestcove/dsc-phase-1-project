    "Considering only the past earnings from box office sales is unlikely to be a good predictor of successful movies in the future. Even if we were to use only the past few years of data, the business model is rapidly changing. With the rise of streaming, many movies aren't released in theaters at all anymore, and the future of movie theaters has become especially uncertain due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes of movies that are the most successful in the theaters may vary from the attributes of movies that are most successful when released only on streaming platforms. The reasons why people may choose to go and watch a movie in the theaters will be different from the reasons people choose to stream a movie: theaters offer an event-like experience with the very large screen and loud surround sound, whereas viewers streaming movies watch them in their homes. \n",
